## MERN is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It represents a full-stack JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications. Here's a brief overview of each component:

## MongoDB:
- MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It's known for its flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data and varied data structures.

## Express.js:
- Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building web servers and handling HTTP requests.

## React.js:
- React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, React.js enables developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of their applications. It's widely used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic user interfaces.

## Node.js: 
- Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside the browser, typically on the server-side. It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for building scalable network applications.
